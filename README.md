# Foundation, for WordPress

Foundation, for WordPress, is a blank starter theme with the exceptional capabilities of [ZURB's Foundation Framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/) and [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/).

"The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak." ~ Hans Hofmann, Introduction to the Bootstrap, 1993

## Features

Foundation, for WordPress, features everything ZURB's Foundation Framework and HTML5 Boilerplate have to offer, however, some changes have been made to tailer it to WordPress, these include:

* A ySlow score of 95 (in regards to 'Small Site or Blog')
* SEO features such as an optomised Google Analytics snippet, robots.txt and Schema.org attributes
* Beautiful, coda-style tooltips
* SlideDown, a simple way to incorporate sliding content
* Reveal for WordPress, a simple modal box by ZURB made to work in WordPress
* Orbit for WordPress, ZURB's image and content slider tailored for WordPress
* A function to provide Google's jQuery CDN over WordPress' local copy
* Failsafe jQuery, with a fallback to WordPress' local copy

## Precautions

Make sure you do not replace elements of this starter theme with elements from ZURB's Foundation Framework, as it will break. Modifications have been made to allow such elements as Orbit, Reveal, Tabs, etc to work within WordPress.

This theme is constantly being updated in relation to ZURB's Foundation.

## Snippets

### Tooltips

Tooltips require a trigger and a data container. Just wrap your entire tooltip, including its trigger, in a class called `bubbleInfo`, and create a trigger with a class of `trigger`. 

```HTML
<div class="bubbleInfo">
  	<a href="#" class="trigger nice button">Tooltips, anyone?</a>
  		<div class="popup">
   			Just a tooltip!
   			<sub>I'm all CSS3.</sub>
   			<div class="popup-arrow-border"></div>
   			<div class="popup-arrow"></div>
 		</div>
</div>
```

### SlideDown

SlideDown is just a simple way to create sliding content. It uses jQueries 'slideToggle', and can run independantly to other SlideDown's. Give your trigger a class of `slideDown` and your content a class of `slideContent`. 

```HTML
<a href="#" class="nice button slideDown">Try me, I slide.</a>
<div class="slideContent">
	I'm the content for the first Slide Down
</div>
```

You can view elements of ZURB's Foundation in their [documentation section](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/). This includes Orbit, Reveal, Tabs etc.
