# Foundation, for WordPress

Foundation, for WordPress, is a blank starter theme with the exceptional capabilities of [ZURB's Foundation Framework](http://foundation.zurb.com/) and [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/).

## Features

Foundation, for WordPress, features everything ZURB's Foundation Framework and HTML5 Boilerplate have to offer, however, some changes have been made to tailer it to WordPress, these include:

* A ySlow score of 95 (in regards to 'Small Site or Blog')
* SEO features such as an optomised Google Analytics snippet, robots.txt and Schema.org attributes
* Beautiful, coda-style tooltips
* SlideDown, a simple way to incorporate sliding content
* Reveal for WordPress, a simple modal box by ZURB made to work in WordPress
* Orbit for WordPress, ZURB's image and content slider tailored for WordPress
* A function to provide Google's jQuery CDN over WordPress' local copy
* Failsafe jQuery, with a fallback to WordPress' local copy

It's literally plug and play. Drop the theme into your wp-content/themes/ directory, along with the kickass .htaccess in your root, and you're good to go - just enable it in your WordPress appearance panel.

In terms of what Foundation offers, you can view their documentation at this address: http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/.

â€¦ But, if you can't be bothered leaving this page, here's a glimpse:

* UI elements, such as tabs, tables, and buttons
* A perfect, fully flexible grid, featuring offsets
* Responsive scripts - if it's web ready, it's mobile ready
* A kickass Modal box, and, of course
* The simplest, most efficient slider ever made, Orbit
