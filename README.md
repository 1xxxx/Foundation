Foundation, for WordPress
=================

Foundation, for WordPress, is a blank canvas with the exceptional capabilities of ZURB's Foundation Framework: http://foundation.zurb.com/.

WordPress + HTML5 Boilerplate + Foundation = <3

Don't leave me behind!

The current versions of both Foundation and FWP:

**ZURB's Foundation**

+ 2.0.1

**Foundation, for WordPress**

+ 1.5

Teach me!

It's literally plug and play. Drop the theme into your wp-content/themes/ directory, along with the kickass .htaccess in your root, and you're good to go - just enable it in your WordPress appearance panel. 

In terms of what Foundation offers, you can view their documentation at this address: http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/.

â€¦ But, if you can't be bothered leaving this page, here's a glimpse:

* UI elements, such as tabs, tables, and buttons
* A perfect, fully flexible grid, featuring offsets
* Responsive scripts - if it's web ready, it's mobile ready
* A kickass Modal box, and, of course
* The simplest, most efficient slider ever made, Orbit

Feel free to do what you want with the theme. It'd be nice to see someone create a full website off it!
